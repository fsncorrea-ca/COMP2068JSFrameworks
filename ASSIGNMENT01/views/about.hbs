<!-- About me Page -->
<h1>{{title}}</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m <strong>Fabiana Correa</strong> — a Brazilian professional currently living in Canada. I have 17 years of experience working with <strong>SAP</strong>, specializing in the <strong>Materials Management (MM)</strong> module. I’m also pursuing a <strong>Postgraduate Certificate in Computer Programming</strong> at <strong>Georgian College</strong>, expanding my technical skills in software development and cloud technologies.</p>

<p><strong>Since 2023</strong>, I’ve been working at <strong>EuroChem</strong>, a global mining and fertilizer company, where I lead <strong>SAP MM upgrade and rollout projects</strong> from <strong>ECC to S/4HANA</strong>. I manage a team of consultants, coordinate TM integration, workflow automation, and process optimization initiatives that enhance efficiency and compliance.</p>

<p><strong>From 2020 to 2023</strong>, I worked at <strong>BCI Consultant</strong> in Brazil, supporting <strong>SAP MM and SD</strong> processes, contributing to <strong>S/4HANA conversion</strong> projects, and improving tax localization and P2P automation for major clients.</p>

<p><strong>Between 2008 and 2018</strong>, I participated in multiple <strong>SAP implementation, rollout, and upgrade projects across Brazil, the U.S., and Germany</strong>, serving renowned clients such as <strong>Whirlpool, Medtronic, Brady, Honeywell, Chemours (DuPont), ABB, Rhodia, Gerdau, Suzano, Lanxess, and Philips</strong>. My roles evolved from <strong>SAP Consultant</strong> to <strong>Solution Architect and Technical Lead</strong>, designing business processes and managing global teams to deliver robust SAP integrations with systems like <strong>PWCE, NFe, and Siscomex</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>My career began in 2006</strong> after earning a <strong>Bachelor’s degree in International Trade</strong> from São Judas Tadeu University. That same year, I joined my first SAP project as a Functional Analyst, marking the beginning of a long and rewarding journey in the technology field.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I love playing <strong>volleyball</strong> and spending time with my family at the beach. I’m passionate about continuous learning, new challenges, and connecting people, technology, and business.</p>
